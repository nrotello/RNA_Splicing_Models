# RNA_Splicing_Models
RNA splicing models and analyses performed at MIT.

The purpose of this repo is to showcase the subset of my work involving computational biology.

Abbreviations: 3SS = 3' Splice Site, PPT = Polypyrimidine Tract

  - HMM_PPT_Model is a two-state (PPT vs. Random) hidden-Markov model of the 3' splice site. I have built three state models in the past (Pre-PPT, PPT, and Post-PPT).
  
  - Heuristic_PPT_Model is a rule-based model to identify PPTs.

  - MLP_NN_SF3B1 is a multi-layer perceptron neural network to predict splice sites that could be sensitive to cryptic splicing upon SF3B1 mutation.

  - CAM_SS_Model is a splice site scoring model that accounts for long-range nucleotide dependencies. I coded it in C++ as well to test performance. Original idea from Chris Burge, MIT.

  - Intronic Conservation is the correlation between splicing factor activity and evolutionary sequence conservation. This is my thesis work.
